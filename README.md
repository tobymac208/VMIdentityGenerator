# VM Identity Generator!
If you're testing virtual machines or trying to kick something up quickly, here is a basic identity generator
that you can use. You just have to have a Python interpreter installed.

I commonly used this if I was spinning up a virtual machine. I got tired of coming up with new passwords, emails, PINs, names, and usernames. So I made this!

## Web Version!

The web interface provides a user-friendly way to generate identity information right in your browser. With just a few clicks, you can:
- Generate random, realistic-looking names
- Create secure passwords that meet common requirements
- Get unique email addresses based on the generated names
- Generate random PINs for testing purposes
- Copy any generated value to your clipboard instantly
- Generate multiple values at once to find the perfect combination

Perfect for developers, testers, or anyone who needs quick, realistic test data without installing anything. Simply open the webpage and start generating!
