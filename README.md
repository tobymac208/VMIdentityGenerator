# VM Identity Generator!
If you're testing virtual machines or trying to kick something up quickly, here is a basic identity generator
that you can use. You just have to have a Python interpreter installed.

I commonly used this if I was spinning up a virtual machine. I got tired of coming up with new passwords, emails, PINs, names, and usernames. So I made this!

### Web Interface Components
- **HTML (`index.html`)**: Provides the structure for the web interface, including input fields and buttons for generating different identity components (names, emails, passwords, etc.).
- **CSS (`styles.css`)**: Handles the styling and layout of the web interface, making it responsive and user-friendly with a clean, modern design.
- **JavaScript (`script.js`)**: Contains the logic for:
  - Generating random identity components
  - Handling user interactions
  - Updating the interface dynamically
  - Managing form submissions and button clicks
